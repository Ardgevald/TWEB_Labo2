Charizard uses flamethrower on Mega-Venusaur

   Suppose Charizard base special attack is 100 (it's 107 in reality)
      effective stat at level 100 -> 205

   Suppose Mega-Venusaur base special defense is 120 (it really is)
      effective stat at level 100 -> 205

   FlameThrower
      Power : 90
   Modifiers
      Super effective               : * 2
      STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) : * 1.5

   Expected damage (using damage formula) (Mega-Venusaur at level 100 has roughly 300 Hp)
      194
   Maximum possible damage
      2670
      6

How to get 2670 ???

   Charizard special attack (with base 100 at level 100)
      205 from base
      +31 from IVs (maxed)
      +63 from EVs (maxed)
      *1.1 from Rash nature
      *2 from stage 2 special attack

      results in a 657.8 special attack

   Additionnal modifiers
      Super effective   -> * 2
      STAB              -> * 1.5
      Sun is harsh      -> * 1.5
      Helping Hand      -> * 1.5
      Blaze             -> * 1.5
      Life Orb          -> * ~1.3 (5324/4096)

   Damage delt in optimal offensive conditions : ~2670 
   that's more than 8 times Mega-Venusaur's hp

How to get 12 ???

   Mega-Venusaur special defense stat
      245 from base
      +31 from IVs (maxed)
      +63 from EVs (maxed)
      *1.1 from Gentle
      *2 from stage 2 special defense
      *1.5 from Assault Vest

      results in a 1118.7


   Additionnal modifiers
      Light Screen   -> * 0.5
      Thick Fat      -> * 0.5
      Rain           -> * 0.5

      (those are still in effect)
      Super effective   -> * 2
      STAB              -> * 1.5

   Damage delt in optimal deffensive conditions : ~6
   That's ~2% of Mega-Venusaur's hp

What if we combine the two ?
   We keep all of the above (the weather is Sunny)
   We arrive with a value of 148 damages, that just not enough to take it down in two attacks
