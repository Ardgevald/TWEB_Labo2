        <p>
          Each pokémon has base stats defining how strong it is in different domains. HP (Hit Points) are the life a Pokémon has. Attack
          and Special Attack defines the power of the physical or special moves the Pokémon uses. Defense and Special Defense
          is for the resistance a Pokémon has against such attacks. And finally, Speed is how fast a Pokémon can attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using thoses stats, we can now look at the power of
          <strong>Flamethrower</strong>. Each move has a power defining the damages you can do with such an attack. Flamethrower
          has a power of 90, which is a pretty strong. But the effective power of Charizard using Flamethrower on Mega-Venusaur
          is
          <strong>270</strong>! The cause of that is two things that you may or may not know.
        </p>
      </div>
      <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-lg-2">Type advantage</dt>
        <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
          This is one of the basis of Pokémon. Each one of them has one or two types and some types are stronger than others. Moves
          also have a type. Flamethrower is obviously
          <span class="type fire">fire</span> type. Mega-Venusaur has
          <span class="type grass">grass</span> type and
          <span class="type poison">poison</span> type. Since
          <span class="type fire">fire</span> is super effective against
          <span class="type grass">grass</span>, the power is doubled.
        </dd>

        <dt class="col-lg-2">STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)</dt>
        <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
          This one is a little less known. If a Pokémon uses a move that is the same type it has, it's more effective. Since both Charizard
          and Flamethower have
          <span class="type fire">fire</span> type, the power's move is 1.5 times more effective
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <div class="row">
        <p>
          Now let's get to the real deal. A Mega-Venusaur at level 100 has around 300 hit points. The damages the attack deals simply
          remove as much HP on the target. If we calculate the damages of this move using the stats that we have, we get
          <strong>194</strong> damage. That is roughly two-thirds of Mega-Venusaur's hit points, which is great, considering that
          it's special-defense is pretty high...
        </p>
        <p>
          But what if I tell you that in the right conditions, we could go up to
          <strong>2670</strong> damages and on other conditions, it will only do as much as
          <strong>6</strong> damages ? Let's see how it works.

      <div class="row">
        <p>
          I didn't told you everything about stats. There is a formula for that too.
          <em>
            <strong>Beware, it can be scary.</strong>

        </div>
        <p>
          Ok, that's not so scary. But you can see that there is more than just the base stat, let's get to them all.
        </p>
        <dl class="row">
          <dt class="col-lg-2">Base</dt>
          <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
            This is the value I showed you earlier. This value has the greatest influence on the effective stat. For Charizard, it's
            107 but let's take 100 to make it simple.
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-lg-2">IV (
            <em>Individual Value</em>)</dt>
          <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
            The Individual Value is a number between 0 and 31 that is represented in each stat. The IV of each Pokémon - even of the
            same species - can be different. It's like it's body characteristics. Some Charizards are faster than other since
            their birth and the IV is there to represent those differences. Let's suppose our Charizard has 31 in Special
            Attack.
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-lg-2">EV (
            <em>Effort Value</em>)</dt>
          <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
            Effort Value is another number, between 0 and 255 for each stat. Unlike IVs, EVs are at 0 when they are born. They represent
            the training that a Pokémon can have for a particular stat. For every 4 EVs, a Pokémon level 100 has 1 more point
            in the effective stat. They gain those EVs by defeating other Pokémons and the stat they affect depends on the
            opponent. For instance, defeating a Charizard rewards 3 EVs in Special Attack. Let's suppose our Charizard has
            maxed EVs in Special Attack, that's 63 more on the effective stat.
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-lg-2">Nature</dt>
          <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
            The nature of a Pokémon also influences his stats. Usually, a nature increases slightly a stat and decreases another by 10%.
            If we suppose our Charizard has a Rash nature, it makes him stronger in Special Attack.
          </dd>

          <dt class="col-lg-2">Stage 2 Special Attack</dt>
          <dd class="col-lg-10 text-justify">
            Some moves can effectively make a stat stronger when in battle. For each stage the stat go up (it can also go down), it modifies
            the stat used for the damage calculation. In this case, we are using a stage 2 Special Attack that makes

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <p>
            With all that, Charizard now has an effective stat of
            <strong>657.8</strong> Special Attack. That is much better.

          Another move that can help is Helping Hand (pun not intended). This move can be used by a Pokémon that is next to our Charizard

          Each Pokémon has a special talent called Abilities that can alter a bunch of things in the game. In this case, Blaze is a
          simple ability that makes
          <span class="type fire">fire</span> moves 1.5 times more effective if it's health is below one third. Let's assume our Charizard got hit
          by his opponent, evil Mega-Venusaur and his health is currently below that point.

          In the Pokémon world, there is also a lot of items that can enhance our Pokémons' abilities if they hold them. Life Orb is
          a simple item. The Pokémon takes 10% damages for each attack he makes but it's more effective by ~1.3 (5324/4096
          exactly, Arceus knows why).

          Instead of giving all we have in offense, let's see in the defensive side. We can greatly affect the outcome by giving everything
          we got to Mega-Venusaur. Full EVs and IVs ? Let's go for it. A good nature and a stage 2 special defense ? It gets
          that. An assault Vest giving him a 1.5 boost in defense ? Just bought it.

        <p>
          With all that, let's add the Thick Fat ability, a little rain instead of a harsh sun and a Light Screen (that's a move, not
          a lotion). For each one of those modifiers, we divide the final damages by 2! STAB and types remain the same.

          What is fun is that if we give both all that we have (let's make it Sunny to even things out) we get to 148 damages, that
          just not enough to take it down in two attacks.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>

      </p>
      <p>
        Just with this example, you can see that there is more depth in a Pokémon battle. We just scratched the surface of how deep and complex it can get.
        For instance, we haven't talked about criticals or special moves. There is some status effects that can alter a Pokémon's stats and behaviour.
        There is also an evasion/precision mechanic that alters if a move does it or not. And there is many abilities, moves or items that can alter all that.
        And that's only if we are talking about battle!
      </p>
      <p>
        And there is a lot of variety in the kind of Pokémons we can have. Stats differ greatly between each one of them. But it's also a world with creatures
        that follow certain rules. Just look at the graph below. It shows the average value of each stat for each type of Pokémon. From that, you can recognize
        some patterns. For instance, if you look at the <span class="type bug">Bug</span> type, you see that the average values are pretty low. That's beacause
        many of the <span class="type bug">Bug</span> Pokémons are early game Pokémons that evolves quickly but are not as strong as others. That's the opposite with
        <span class="type dragon">Dragon</span> Pokémons which can be found at the end game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other things you can gather. <span class="type flying">Flying</span> Pokémons are faster than the others types and <span class="type steel">Steel</span> Pokémons
        have the highest Defense by far. <span class="type fighting">Fighting</span> Pokémons uses mainly contact and physical moves, so their Attack is very high compared
        to their Special Attack that is very low. You can see that it's the opposite with <span class="type psychic">Psychic</span> Pokémons.
      </p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        You can put your mouse over a stat to get it's value and hide other stats a little. You can also click on the legend on the right to completely hide every stat but one.
        Click on another to change, or on the same one to get them all back.
